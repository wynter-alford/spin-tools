# spin-tools
Tools for measuring fidelity of a pulse sequence and calculating magnus expansion terms.  The main code is contained in *fullMagnusOneParam.m* while results are periodically updated and posted in *Magnus Tools.ipynb*

### sequenceAnalysis.m
This is the main script used to generate results.  Contains code to calculate up to the 4th order term in the Magnus Expansion for a pulse sequence.  Calculates the fidelity of an experimental sequence relative to an expected theoretical unitary operator based on the zeroth, zeroth through second, and (when enabled) zeroth through fourth order terms.  A few other potentially interesting fidelities are also included.  Includes code to simulate a number of pulse sequences, and more can be added easily by modifying the "getSequence" function. Note that this script requires use of the functions found in the "code" directory in order to function.

### Magnus Tools.ipynb
The first section of this notebook outlines the code used to compute the terms of the magnus expansion for various pulse sequences.  The second section contains all of the results generated by simulations through March 2021.  More recent results have not yet been updated here.

### Decrepit
Contains a number of scripts which were formerly used to collect results and are stored here for posterity.  These should no longer be used as all updates are now being made to sequenceAnalysis.m
