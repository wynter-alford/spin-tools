# spin-tools
Tools for measuring fidelity of a pulse sequence and calculating magnus expansion terms.  The main code is contained in *fullMagnusOneParam.m* while results are periodically updated and posted in *Magnus Tools.ipynb*

### fullMagnusOneParam_FIDS.m
Contains code to calculate up to the 4th order term (by default the 3rd and 4th order terms are commented out since they take a long time to calculate) in the Magnus Expansion for a pulse sequence.  Calculates the fidelity of an experimental sequence relative to an expected theoretical unitary operator based on the zeroth, zeroth through second, and (when enabled) zeroth through fourth order terms.  A few other potentially interesting fidelities are also included.

### Magnus Tools.ipynb
The first section of this notebook outlines the code used to compute the terms of the magnus expansion for various pulse sequences.  The second section contains all of the results generated by simulations so far.

### One Parameter SpinSim.ipynb
This script generates 1D plots of fidelity from a single parameter for various pulse sequences.

### oldFullAnalysis.m
This is the script used during the summer/fall of 2020 to compute fidelity varying all four parameters.

### fullAnalysis.m
This was intended to work as an updated version of *oldFullAnalysis.m* that was more efficient.  The code to generate the first and second order terms of the average Hamiltonian was also included so that fidelity could be computed using the first three terms to approximate the Hamiltonian instead of just the zeroth order term.  However, the results this code produced when considering fidelity w.r.t. the zeroth order average Hamiltonian did not match up to the results from *oldFullAnalysis.m*.  This discrepancy has not yet been resolved.

### fullMagnusGrid.m
Decrepit.

## code
Contains several utility functions required to run some of the above scripts, with the exception of fullMagnusOneParam which has all functions defined at the end of the script.
